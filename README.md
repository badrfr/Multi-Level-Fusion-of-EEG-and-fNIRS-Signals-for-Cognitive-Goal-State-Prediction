# Adaptive Fusion of EEG and NIRS with Explainable AI Reveals Neurophysiological Markers of Cognitive Flexibility

## 🧠 Overview

This repository hosts the complete codebase and datasets for our research study: **"Adaptive Fusion of EEG and NIRS with Explainable AI Reveals Neurophysiological Markers of Cognitive Flexibility"**

Our work investigates how **electroencephalography (EEG)** and **near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)**, combined through advanced machine learning and explainable AI, can reveal robust biomarkers of cognitive flexibility during probabilistic reversal learning tasks.

### 🎯 Key Findings
- **87.78% accuracy** achieved with late fusion + dynamic gating
- **EEG variance** emerges as most discriminative feature (59.2% importance)
- **42% increase** in oxygen consumption during exploratory cognitive states
- **55.4% variance reduction** compared to baseline fusion methods

## 🎯 Research Objectives

We aimed to develop and validate multimodal EEG-NIRS biomarkers of cognitive flexibility by:

1. **Evaluating** EEG vs NIRS discriminative capacity for goal-directed (AO) vs exploratory (SO) cognitive states
2. **Comparing** classical ML models with deep neural networks
3. **Investigating** fusion strategies: early, intermediate, and late fusion
4. **Applying** SHAP for interpretability and neurophysiological marker identification

### Research Questions Addressed
- **RQ1**: Can EEG and NIRS reliably discriminate AO vs SO cognitive states?
- **RQ2**: Do multimodal fusion strategies improve classification over unimodal approaches?
- **RQ3**: What are the strengths/weaknesses of different fusion strategies?
- **RQ4**: How does SHAP enhance interpretability of biomarkers?

- **Participants**: 42 participants (21 AO, 21 SO groups)
- **Data modalities**: EEG (8 electrodes, 512 Hz) + NIRS (1024 channels, 4 Hz)

### Performance Hierarchy
| Approach | EEG Accuracy | NIRS Accuracy | Multimodal Accuracy |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Unimodal Best** | 81.0% (Logistic Regression) | 64.7% (Random Forest) | - |
| **Early Fusion** | - | - | 66.1% (SVM) |
| **Intermediate Fusion** | - | - | 70.6% (Logistic Regression) |
| **Late Fusion + Dynamic Gating** | - | - | **87.78% ± 7.9%** |

### Neurophysiological Insights
- **EEG findings**: 48% increase in signal variance for exploratory states
- **NIRS findings**: 42% increase in oxygen consumption during exploration
- **Convergent evidence**: Electrical hyperactivation correlates with metabolic demands
